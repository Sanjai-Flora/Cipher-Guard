## How to Use:

### Installation:

- Clone the repository: ```git clone https://github.com/your-username/Cipher-Guard.git```
- Navigate to the project directory: ```cd Cipher-Guard```
- Install the required libraries: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### Running the Application:

- Execute the main script: python ```main.py```

### Using Cipher Guard:

- Entering a Passphrase: Type a strong passphrase. A strength indicator will guide you.
- Choosing an Algorithm: Select AES-256-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305.
- Selecting Files/Folders: Use "Select File(s)" or "Select Folder."
- Encrypting/Decrypting: Click "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" and confirm your passphrase. A progress bar will show the status.
- Notes: Securely store sensitive text using the "Note" button.
- History: View your encryption/decryption history.

## Security Considerations:

- Passphrase Strength: Use a strong and unique passphrase for maximum security.
- Password Management: Store your passphrase securely. Forgetting it will result in permanent data loss.
- Backup Your Data: Always maintain backups of your important files, as encryption is not a substitute for a comprehensive backup strategy.
